# Black Coffer Sentiment

## About 
The project aims to perform sentiment analysis on a diverse collection of data science articles sourced from insights.blackcoffer.com. By leveraging web scraping techniques, I extracted a wide range of articles discussing various aspects of data science, such as machine learning, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. Through natural language processing and sentiment analysis algorithms, I assessed the sentiments expressed in these articles, identifying whether the tone is positive, negative, or neutral. The findings from this automated analysis provided valuable insights into the prevailing sentiments and attitudes towards data science in the digital sphere, aiding businesses, researchers, and data enthusiasts in understanding public opinions and trends within the data science domain.
